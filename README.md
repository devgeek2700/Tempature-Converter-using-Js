During my learning basic of JavaScript, I had the opportunity to develop this project which is a Tempature converter website. This project involved creating a user-friendly interface that allowed users to convert degrees between different temperature scales.

I implemented various functionalities to ensure accurate and efficient conversions, including the ability to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and Celsius to Kelvin.
